What did you like about this website?
I found the theme to serve a pretty specific audience. It looks likes its purpose is to promote a greek organization at Jmu, perhaps for people looking to join a very specific organization. Perhaps if the theme were more generic, maybe about rush at Jmu in the abstract, the theme would be more encompassing. 
Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
Which has a better user experience (and why)?
	This website has a user experience that is better at structure. Everything flows more properly than my website.  
Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
Maybe one .css file would be more maintainable. 
Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
The website is good navigation, the multitude of css files can be a little jarring, but great nonetheless. 
if not, suggest some specific improvements
Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
were semantically appropriate elements selected
Everything was appropriately selected to create a proper structure. I like he use of divs and links and the dropdown css animation. 
is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
There are multiple .css files, but each contains very little code to serve specific html files. The naing structure aligns with the html. There is not very much duplication. 
Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
	I would say this is great, but maybe consider adding some labels for users that are vision impaired. There are some pages, like the about section, that contain a little too much content to be taken all at once.
